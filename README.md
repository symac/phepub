PHEpub
======
Goal of this tool is to provide an easy way to export lessons from [programminghistorian.org/](https://programminghistorian.org/) to EPUB format.

As of April 2018, it is still a work in progress, currently able to handle : 

- getting lessons from github
- checking for update to lessons on github (/web/check-for-updates)
- starting to export some of them as EPUB

What still needs to be done is : 

- set it to update periodically 
- give the user an interface to choose which lessons to download as en EPUB (all by default, offering possibility to select only some of them, maybe by topic ?)
- "beautify" the EPUB using a css
